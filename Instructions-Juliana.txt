Instructions for Juliana:

Main Idea:
- Going to play back bag files from each robot simultaneously and view them in Rviz
- Bag files need to be paired together such that the environment looks the same from robot centric view (e.g. that yellow penske truck being there or not)
- Going to use VokoScreen to take screen captures of everything going on in Rviz


Instructions for running:
- Check the '''Playback Bag Files''' portion of the README.md file inside the mrsearch repo under the curiosity_nrg branch
- Videos using vokoscreen:
	- Use the area functionality so that you can exclude the borders and images from the videos
	- note that we will take videos on the RGB cameras separately and we will also run them with 
	  YOLO
	- Link for installing Vokoscreen on Linux: https://www.howtoinstall.me/ubuntu/18-04/vokoscreen/
